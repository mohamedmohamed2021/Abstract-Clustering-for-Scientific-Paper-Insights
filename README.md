# Goal of this Project

The primary objective of this project is to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster scientific papers based on their abstracts.

By leveraging clustering algorithms for labeling and employing dimensionality reduction methods for visual representation, we aim to create a scatter plot that captures the relationships between papers with similar topics. Papers sharing common themes will be grouped together and plotted in close proximity. Additionally, if the clustering process yields satisfactory results, we will explore the clusters further using topic modeling to extract the most relevant keywords associated with each cluster. This analysis will help identify publications with similar research backgrounds and facilitate comparisons between similar studies and articles.

To ensure the data is suitable for clustering, we will preprocess it using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Throughout the project, we will also investigate the impact of various preprocessing steps on cluster quality. This includes exploring approaches such as stop word removal, handling multilingual data, and employing diverse vectorization strategies to optimize the clustering results.
